What is Terraform Workspace?
Workspaces are commonly used to manage different environments such as development, staging, and production.
Each workspace can represent a distinct environment with its own set of resources and configurations. 
It allows you to manage different sets of resources independently. For example, you might have one workspace for your development environment and another for your production environment. Each workspace has its own set of resources and configurations.
